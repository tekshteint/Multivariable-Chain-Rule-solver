# Multivariable-Chain-Rule-solver
A simple multivariable chain rule solver written in python. Its hard to check your work when there aren't any calculators out there on the web and this makes that process take about 10 seconds compared to jumping between 3 tabs to input many separate things for the same end result. This will also check if you have the sympy module downloaded and download it if neccesary.


You'll enter a total of 3 equations: Z equation, x(t), and y(t). In return, youll get your partial derivatives and end result.

Pretty neat huh
